The goal of this project is to provide a template for creating C++ applications that use the CppCurses library that can run on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

This project uses C++20, and ncurses for Linux and Mac OS X, and pcurses for Windows.

This project automatically buids on the first of every month to make sure nothing breaks.

The project aims to:

* `[x]` Pull and link to ncurses on Linux and Mac OS X
* `[x]` Pull and link to pcurses on Windows
* `[x]` User Github actions to build on Windows, Mac and Ubuntu
